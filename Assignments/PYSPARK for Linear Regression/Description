Build a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. You must train a binary classification model. 

The data set is provided. The shape of the dataset is (145460, 23). 

Perform the following actions on the dataset before building the model.

1.	Explore the dataset to find what are the categorical variables in the dataset. List categorical variable names.
2.	Explore how many categorical variables have null values. 
3.	Get the frequency count of each categorical variable. For instance, how many discrete values are in each categorical variable and how many data points are from each distinct value?
4.	Print the first five rows of the dataset.
5.	What are the available columns of the dataset?
6.	Drop RISK_MM variable column.
7.	Get the summary of the dataset.
8.	List the first five rows only for categorical variables.
9.	Decompose the date field into year, month, and day fields. Then drop the original date field.
10.	How many unique locations are there in the dataset?
11.	Print the number of times each unique location appears in the dataset.
12.	Perform One Hot Encoding for each categorical variable.
13.	The Rain Tomorrow is the label, and all other fields are features.
14.	You may use each field's median value (median imputation) to fill null values if it is a numerical column. Use the most frequent value in the case of a categorical column.
15.	Normalise each numerical column (bring it to a value between 0 and 1)
16.	Train your Logistic Regression model on the training dataset (70% 30% split).
17.	Predict the Rain tomorrow for the test set.
18.	Describe your model's performance using the confusion matrix and print TP, TN, FP, and FN. In addition, provide the accuracy and F1 score of your model.
