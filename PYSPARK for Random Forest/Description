Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom Industry using Random Forest

The telecommunications industry faces the challenge of customer churn,
where customers switch from one service provider to another. In this project,
you'll develop a predictive model using Random Forest to identify customers
who are likely to churn based on their usage patterns and demographics. The
goal is to help telecom companies proactively retain customers by targeting
them with personalized retention strategies.

Project Tasks:
1. Data set and Exploration:
   Use the dataset provided (Telecom_Churn.csv).
   Explore the data to understand its distribution, identify missing
    values, outliers, and correlations between different features.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding
    categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as required.
   Perform feature engineering to create new features or transform
    existing ones that may be more informative for predicting churn.
3. Model Development:
   Implement a Random Forest classifier using libraries found in
    pyspark (use python as the base language).
   Split the data into training and testing sets and train the Random
    Forest model on the training data.
   Tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model using
    techniques like grid search or random search to optimize
    performance.
4. Model Evaluation:
   Evaluate the performance of the trained Random Forest model
    using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision,
    recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
   Visualize the model's performance using techniques like ROC
    curves and confusion matrices to gain insights into its strengths
    and weaknesses.
